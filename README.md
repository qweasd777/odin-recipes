# Odin Recipes

A recipe website that uses basic HTML and CSS. 

## About

This is my first-ever website I've created following The Odin Project's (TOP) Foundations Course. The project was further enhanced throughout the course with basic CSS. 

Although not very appealing to look at, it was fun and fulfilling to apply what I've learnt so far on HTML (and CSS) and finally get something out.
